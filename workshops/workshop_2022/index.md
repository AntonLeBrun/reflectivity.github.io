The Annual Meeting of ORSO will take place online in 7th-10th June 2021. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss topics of interest to the ORSO community.
The program will consist of scientific and technical talks together with discussion forums and/or hackathons for each of the working groups
Since the agenda is scheduled to try to cover all time zones, we acknowledge that it may be difficult to attend all these sessions. We will therefore record as much of the meeting as possible and post the videos on the ORSO youtube channel.
We will be running an electronic vote on at least 1 issue during the meeting. The topics of the votes will be presented in the first session and then votes accepted during the week.

For those interested a report from last year's meeting is [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/08940886.2022.2043671)

## Registration will soon [open](https://indico.esss.lu.se/event/3013/)

# Agenda:

The agenda is now available [here](https://indico.esss.lu.se/event/3013/timetable/) using the european time zone.

## Tuesday 7th June: Plenary Session

09:00-11:30 (UK), 10:00-12:30 (Europe), 05:00-07:30 (US East coast), 18:00-20:30 (Australia East coast):

- General introduction to the meeting and how it will work
- Science talk to be confirmed
- The AGM. Explanation of ORSO organisation and election of 4 chairs (1 from each working group)
- A presentation of the ORSOPY file format. We will be voting on the release of this as the first major output from ORSO

Recordings of the talks will be uploaded and made available to all to ensure access from all time zones.


## Tuesday 7th June: Collection of Teaching Materials 

18:00-21:00 (UK), 19:00-22:00 (Europe), 13:00-16:00 (US East coast), 03:00-06:00 (Australia East coast): 

The aim of this session is to build on the existing work at https://www.reflectometry.org/isis_school/ (URL to change), a short introduction to reflectometry fitting.

In this session, we will discuss what material would be useful for the webpage. There will bean instruction on how to add material to the page and then we will 
work in small groups to develop new material for the webpages. 

The specific areas of focus will depend on the attendees but some potential areas of work include:
- Tools for analysing data
- Expanding Bayesian analysis section
- Updating the X-ray reference material
- Proof reading

The aim in this session is to update the webpage live in a "hackathon". Please come prepared by reading through the current material to identigfy information gaps or bad links and potentially getting a Github account.

You do not need to be confident with Github to participate, what we need is expertise in reflectometry to ensure that the material generated is of high quality and appropriate for the whole ORSO community.


## Wednesday 8th June: ORSO Webpage Workshop

09:00-11:30 (UK), 10:00-12:30 (Europe), 05:00-07:30 (US East coast), 18:00-20:30 (Australia East coast):

The aim of this session is to review the ORSO webpages and update them live in the session according to input.

We will begin with a short talk explaining how you can edit the pages. Then we will ensure that all those present have permission to do so.

Following a short discussion to identify topics, we will  work in small groups to implement changes, collect information and actively modify pages.

The specific areas of focus will depend on the attendees but some potential areas of work include:
- Bibliography
- Beamline lists and publications
- Site navigation


## Wednesday 8th June: [Priors and posteriors paper](/assets/ms.pdf)

14:00-16:00 (UK), 15:00-17:00 (Europe), 09:00-11:00 (US East coast), 22:00-00:00 (Australia East coast): 

Introduction talk "Interperting reflectrometry data with Bayesian analysis" (Andrew McCluskey)

More and more Bayesian analysis is being used to interpret reflectometry data.
However, how this information is reported is inconsistent potentially limiting the replicability and reproduciblity of the results. 
To improve this, within the Reproduciblity Working Group, we have started to develop a short publication defining some best practice for reporting results and inputs to Bayesian analysis. 

In this session, we first present and then seek feedback on the [current draft of the paper](/assets/ms.pdf) and will aim to improve the work based on this feedback. 
Note: the expectation for attending this session is that **you have read [the draft](/assets/ms.pdf) in advance and are able to offer feedback**, it is not expected that you are an expert user of Bayesian analysis (as you might be the exact audience that we are targeting in that case). 
Attendence of this session will lead to inclusion as a co-author of the paper (if desired).

## Thursday 9th June: The ORSO Scattering Length Database
