The Annual Meeting of ORSO will take place __online__ (Zoom) on 7th-10th June 2021. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss topics of interest to the ORSO community.
The program will consist of scientific and technical talks together with discussion forums and/or activity based sessions for each of the working groups
Since the agenda is scheduled to try to cover all time zones, we acknowledge that it may be difficult to attend all these sessions. We will therefore record as much of the meeting as possible and post the videos on the ORSO youtube channel.
We will be running an electronic vote on at least 1 issue during the meeting. The topics of the votes will be notified to registants prior to the start of the workshop and presented in the first session before votes accepted electronically during the week.

For those interested a report from last year's meeting is [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/08940886.2022.2043671)

## Registration is now [open](https://indico.esss.lu.se/event/3013/)

# Agenda:

The agenda is not yet finalized but the confirmed details are below and [here](https://indico.esss.lu.se/event/3013/timetable/) using the european time zone.

## Tuesday 7th June: Plenary Session (Chair: Tom Arnold)

09:00-11:30 (UK), 10:00-12:30 (Europe), 05:00-07:30 (US East coast), 18:00-20:30 (Australia East coast):

- General introduction to the meeting and how it will work
- Wiebke Lohstroh: Introduction to the DAPHNE project
- The AGM. Explanation of ORSO organisation, voting methodology and election of 4 chairs (1 from each working group)
- A presentation of the [ORSOPY](https://pypi.org/project/orsopy/). __We will be voting on the release of this as the first major output from ORSO__

Recordings of the talks will be uploaded and made available to all to ensure access from all time zones.


## Tuesday 7th June: Collection of Teaching Materials (Chair: Andrew McCluskey)

17:00-20:00 (UK), 18:00-21:00 (Europe), 12:00-15:00 (US East coast), 02:00-05:00 (Australia East coast): 

The aim of this session is to build on the existing work at https://www.reflectometry.org/isis_school/ (URL to change), a short introduction to reflectometry fitting.

In this session, we will discuss what material would be useful for the webpage. There will bean instruction on how to add material to the page and then we will 
work in small groups to develop new material for the webpages. 

The specific areas of focus will depend on the attendees but some potential areas of work include:
- Tools for analysing data
- Expanding Bayesian analysis section
- Updating the X-ray reference material
- Proof reading

The aim in this session is to update the webpage live in a "hackathon". Please come prepared by reading through the current material to identigfy information gaps or bad links and potentially getting a Github account.

You do not need to be confident with Github to participate, what we need is expertise in reflectometry to ensure that the material generated is of high quality and appropriate for the whole ORSO community.


## Wednesday 8th June: ORSO Webpage Workshop (Chair: Tom Arnold)

09:00-11:30 (UK), 10:00-12:30 (Europe), 05:00-07:30 (US East coast), 18:00-20:30 (Australia East coast):

The aim of this session is to review the ORSO webpages and update them live in the session according to input.

We will begin with a short talk explaining how you can edit the pages. Then we will ensure that all those present have permission to do so.

Following a short discussion to identify topics, we will  work in small groups to implement changes, collect information and actively modify pages.

The specific areas of focus will depend on the attendees but some potential areas of work include:
- Bibliography
- Beamline lists and publications
- Site navigation


## Wednesday 8th June: [Priors and posteriors paper](/assets/ms.pdf) (Chair: Andrew McCluskey)

14:00-16:00 (UK), 15:00-17:00 (Europe), 09:00-11:00 (US East coast), 22:00-00:00 (Australia East coast): 

Introduction talk "Interperting reflectrometry data with Bayesian analysis" (Andrew McCluskey)

More and more Bayesian analysis is being used to interpret reflectometry data.
However, how this information is reported is inconsistent potentially limiting the replicability and reproduciblity of the results. 
To improve this, within the Reproduciblity Working Group, we have started to develop a short publication defining some best practice for reporting results and inputs to Bayesian analysis. 

In this session, we first present and then seek feedback on the [current draft of the paper](/assets/ms.pdf) and will aim to improve the work based on this feedback. 
Note: the expectation for attending this session is that **you have read [the draft](/assets/ms.pdf) in advance and are able to offer feedback**, it is not expected that you are an expert user of Bayesian analysis (as you might be the exact audience that we are targeting in that case). 
Attendence of this session will lead to inclusion as a co-author of the paper (if desired).

## Thursday 9th June: Plenary Session (Chair: Max Skoda)

09:00-10:00 (UK), 10:00-11:00 (Europe), 05:00-06:00 (US East coast), 18:00-19:00 (Australia East coast):

- Hayden Robertson: Refellips
- Alessandro Greco: mlreflect â€“ a Python-based pipeline for neutron and X-ray reflectivity data analysis using neural networks

## Thursday 9th June: A Simple model language (Chair: )

10:00-11:00 (UK), 11:00-12:00 (Europe), 06:00-07:00 (US East coast), 19:00-20:00 (Australia East coast):

- One of the early aims of the Data Analysis Workig Groups was to create a common vocabulary for the definitionn of reflectometry models.
- This session will demo the model languages that have started to be developed and will conntinue with a discussion
- further details to be confirmed


## Thursday 9th June: The ORSO Scattering Length Density Database (Chair: Artur Glavic)

The aim of this session is to launch the ORSO Scattering Length Density Database. A database exists but we now need to add the necessary data to make it useful to the community. The intention is that this database is maintained by the people that use it, so we need your input to make it work. 

- Presentation of the status of the [SLD database](https://slddb.esss.dk/slddb/) (Artur Glavic)
- Information gathering excercise and release of the database

## Friday 10th June: General description for resolution functions  (Chair: Andrew Nelson)

09:00-10:00 (UK), 10:00-11:00 (Europe), 05:00-06:00 (US East coast), 18:00-19:00 (Australia East coast):

The collective action for nomadic small angle scatterers, CanSAS (https://www.cansas.org/) will present their work on resolution functions:

The numerical convolutions of the appropriate functions for fixed wavelength SANS gives improved Q resolution functions that are slightly flatter in the peak and broader in the tails than the classic Mildner & Carpenter approach. However, in time-of-flight SANS the resolution curves from all the wavelengths contributing to a particular Q value are averaged together, weighted by the number of neutrons detected at each wavelength. Since the resolution width is inversely proportional to wavelength this often gives a curve that is noticeably sharper in the peak and broader in the tails than a simple Gaussian.

In either type of SANS measurement a more detailed description of Q resolution smearing within fitting programs such as SasView will need generic resolution functions of arbitrary shape.

The generic resolution function was subject of discussion at CanSAS workshop in March 2021 and efforts have been for devising data format and using arbitrary function in SasView. The summary of these activities will be provided in the presentation

- presentation of the work being done by Cansas (Wojciech Potrzebowski)
- discussion of relevance to ORSO and the potential for collaboration
