**Reproducibility 1a**


Artur Glavic, Jos Cooper Brian Maranville, Christy Kinane, Mathieu Doucet, Mark Schlossman, Binhua Lin


- Publishing the resource (of how to make a measurement reproducible) is important, but also can be a reward for the contributors.

- The round robin samples should be published in a reproducible way?

- A liquid version of the round robins?

- Reproducibility is separated into instrument specifics (systematic errors), a reproducible measurement procedure, and a reproducible analysis

- Systematic errors (in instrument)? Defined list?

- File formats defining terms to use – tie in

- Reproducibility of reduced data, and of final answer (Qc should be in the same place for example, as well as all giving the same analysed result)

- Would like a “how to test/build a reflectometer” type guide, as this would have to contain reproducible measurements

- X-ray beamlines are generally separate with very little cross facility collaboration/cross checking, reduction software often written by IS’s.

- A list of pet “standard” samples which people run on their own beamlines? E.g. Ni film, DPPC, DMPC, etc…

- Any other techniques which could be used to cross compare? (make a list along with what they give and their difficulties)


**TODO**

- Brian to make a webpage to describe reproducible measurement,

- Everyone to contribute all corrections we do

- CJK to start a “how to make a beamline” document (for neutrons)
