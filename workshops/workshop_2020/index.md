Due to the cancellation of the SXNS16 conference, the planned ORSO satellite workshop was taken online. Over 40 of the worlds experts in X-ray and neutron reflectivity from various large-scale facilities took part in a successful meeting. Each of the working groups had a number of fruitful discussions and a list of actions has been created for each of the [working groups](https://www.reflectometry.org/working_groups/)

A report for this meeting has now been published in [Neutron News](https://doi.org/10.1080/10448632.2021.1875749) and [Synchrotron Radiation News](https://doi.org/10.1080/08940886.2020.1812362)

The meeting was held over 3 days: **26-28th May** and consisted of:

- **26th May**: An introductory webinar explaining how to participate in the event, with some brief presentations on the progress of ORSO to date. A recording of this webinar can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/431424465/0f8be60bf8).
- **26th-28th May**: small working groups sessions (typically an hour in length) to discuss specific topics.
- **28th May**: Closing webinar. One individual nominated from each of the sessions presented a summary to the whole group.                    

### Sessions

The outcomes of the working group sessions are summarized below with more detail on [the working group pages](https://www.reflectometry.org/working_groups/):

- **[File Formats](https://www.reflectometry.org/working_groups/file_formats/)**: Chaired by Jochen Stahn

The outcome of the file formats working group discussions can be summarized simply as “we want to stick to the principles whenever possible - and at the same time we are flexible and pragmatic and pay respect to traditions.” This attitude is exemplified by the agreement to generally use SI units, but to also allow Ångströms. The broad conclusion of the discussions is to develop two file formats; one strict and one pragmatic. The strict format will fulfil the principles of inter-operability and reusability, most likely using a NeXus-based hierarchical data format (HDF). Meanwhile the pragmatic format will be easily human-readable, compatible with legacy analysis software but also contain the essential information to trace back to its origin and some basics about the state of the data reduction.

- **[Data Analysis](https://www.reflectometry.org/working_groups/analysis/)**: Chaired by Brian Maranville

The data analysis working group discussed how the many existing analysis software packages should cooperate. This included the possible creation of generic or shared calculation engines and the definition of a vocabulary that allows for a consistent parameterization of models. The group plans to develop a set of reference calculations for reflectometry (with inputs and outputs) to ensure robustness across analysis software.

- **[Reproducibility](https://www.reflectometry.org/working_groups/reproducibility/)**: Chaired by Andrew McCluskey

The reproducibility working group sessions focussed on defining how we can work to improve reproducibility in reflectometry measurement, reduction, and analysis. In particular, focussing on how we can collaborate to produce reproducible methods for measurement, and help others create reproducible analyses. The discussions concluded with three principle actions going forward, the creation of informative documentation regarding the set-up and standardisation of instrumentation, the generation of guidelines for the expected steps required for accurate and reproducible data reduction and the writing of some “how-to” guides to encourage reproducible data analysis.

- **[Education and Outreach](https://www.reflectometry.org/working_groups/edu_and_outreach)**: Chaired by Tom Arnold

The education and outreach working group discussions were able to define the scope of the working group and discussed some detail on the design and content of the website and how to secure the long-term future of the ORSO collaboration. Going forward this working group will be responsible for the publicity for the organisation, including the website, the dissemination of standards and the organization of annual meetings.
