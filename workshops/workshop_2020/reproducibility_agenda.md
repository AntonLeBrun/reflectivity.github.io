## [ORSO workshop 2020](/workshops/workshop_2020)

<span class="c2 c20">Session 1: Detailed introduction & aims of this working group -- (26th 16:30/27th 08:00)</span>

*   <span class="c1">The chair should briefly introduce the working group</span>
*   <span class="c1">The working group is focused on Reproducibility, in measurement and analysis</span>
*   <span class="c1">We all (hopefully) believe that reproducibility is important, however it is frequently overlooked</span>
*   <span class="c1">We want to develop strategies to ensure that our measurements are conducted, reduced, and analysed in a reproducible fashion</span>
*   <span class="c5">We have a presence on GitHub (</span><span class="c5 c21">[https://github.com/reflectivity/reproducibility](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/reflectivity/reproducibility&sa=D&ust=1590502364784000)</span><span class="c1">), which includes some “Goals”</span>
*   <span class="c1">We want to generate a resource explaining why reproducibility in NR and XRR are important (session 2)</span>
*   <span class="c1">We have started building a folder of “examples” of reproducible analysis</span>
*   <span class="c1">We want a list of papers that represent a high standard of reproducibility (for others to aim for)</span>
*   <span class="c1">Does anyone have other ideas for **achievable** goals?</span>

<span class="c5">        </span><span class="c20 c2">AIMS</span>

*   <span class="c1">Define a list of requirements for a reproducible measurement standard and how it would be documented</span>
*   <span class="c1">Define a list of requirements for the reproducible analysis of data</span>
*   <span class="c1">Identify individuals who will continue to work on these projects (item one; move towards a definition of this measurement standard, item two; develop a standardised protocol for producing such an analysis “workflow”)</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c20 c2">Session 2: How to communicate the importance of reproducibility? -- (26th 22:30/28th 10:00)</span>

*   <span class="c1">Reproducibility is important but showing if can be difficult</span>
*   <span class="c1">Most users are too busy chasing the “science” to worry about showing their analysis is reproducible</span>
*   <span class="c1">Few will worry about their data reduction being reproducible</span>
*   <span class="c1">How can we show the importance of this</span>

<span class="c20 c2">AIMS</span>

*   <span class="c1">Develop a list of reasons why reproducibility is important in neutron and X-ray reflectometry</span>
*   <span class="c1">Give reasons why these aspects are important to users</span>
*   <span class="c1">Identify individuals who will continent this project (ideal situation is a publication showing the benefits of reproducibility to the user and presents problems from a lack of it).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c2">Session 3: What are our expectations for reproducibility? -- (27th 11:00/27th 22:30)</span>

*   <span class="c5">If we are going to evangelise reproducibility, we need to set reaso</span><span class="c5">nable expectations</span>
*   <span class="c1">We should be the bar that we expect, for example when we peer review a publication?</span>
*   <span class="c1">Should there be a “reproducibility expectation” when beamtime is applied for?</span>
*   <span class="c1">The bar **needs** to be shared openly so that people can aim for it</span>
*   <span class="c1">How should we advertise the bar (publication?)?</span>

<span class="c2">AIMS</span>

*   <span class="c1">Revise the lists from session 1 to find a “reasonable expectation”</span>
*   <span class="c1">Detail why items have been added/removed</span>
*   <span class="c5">Identify individuals who will continue (ideally resulting in a page for the website that gives</span> <span class="c2">our</span><span class="c1"> bare minimum to be considered “reproducible”.</span>
