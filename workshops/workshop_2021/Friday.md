- Example usage from other software with the python API and HTTP interface
- How to present result data for neutrons/x-rays optimally for soft-/hard-matter (SLD unit etc.)

- ORSO procedure for validating input data 
- If there's time... Actual DB implementation, package, modules, classes, unit tests
