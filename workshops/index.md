[ChemMatCars Seminars](https://chemmatcars.uchicago.edu/education-and-outreach/soft-matter-interest-group-seminar/)


Each of the ORSO working groups meet approximately quarterly to review open issues.

For most recent activities please check github issues for each working group:
- [Education and Outreach](https://github.com/reflectivity/edu_outreach/issues)
- [Reproducibility](https://github.com/reflectivity//reproducibility/issues)
- [File formats](https://github.com/reflectivity/file_format/issues)
- [Data analysis](https://github.com/reflectivity/analysis/issues)

A general workshop is planned to include a wider attendance once per year.
If you would like to participate in any of these meetings, sign up to the mailing list or contact the chair of the relevant working group directly.
