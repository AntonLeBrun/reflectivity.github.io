This is an online home for a collaborative network of scientists interested in neutron and X-ray reflectometry.

We are still working on a name and a shape for this community.

If you would like to be involved please contact [Andrew](mailto:andrew.mccluskey@diamond.ac.uk) and he will make you an owner on the [GitHub](https://github.com/reflectivity) organisation.
