<h3> Structure </h3>

Each of the sessions will be lead by a chair.
The chair will set the scene for the session by providing information about the current state of the art, as well as their opinion on how the area may be advanced (these primers will be shared with participants before the event).
Finally, the chair will set out 2-3 discussion topics to be tackled during the sessions.
Attendees will then break into groups of ~5 to discuss each of the topics and feedback to the large group, gradually working through each topic.
During the feedback sessions, one of the organisers will minute the feedback, to be shared on this web resource for posterity.

<h3> Location </h3>

The workshop will take place at [Cosener's House](https://www.thecosenershouse.co.uk) in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Please see the map below for a more accurate location.
