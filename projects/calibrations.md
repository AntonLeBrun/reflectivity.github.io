In this page, we are looking to harvest information about calibrations that are performed at neutron reflectometry instruments.
For a given calibration, please include the following information:
- What is being calibrated?
- How is the calibration performed?
- An example of the calibrated data and details of how you get this information
- References/Code for the above would be great!

Once you add your calibration, please include yourself in the authors of this page.
