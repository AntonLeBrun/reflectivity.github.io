We are currently developing a online SLD Database.
More information about this project can be found on the following [issue](https://github.com/reflectivity/edu_outreach/issues/2) and in the [slddb](https://github.com/reflectivity/slddb) repository.

The progess was recently discussed at the [3rd ORSO workshop (June 2021)](https://www.reflectometry.org/workshops/workshop_2021/Friday.md/)

As part of that **An alpha version of the database is now live [here](https://slddb.esss.dk)**
