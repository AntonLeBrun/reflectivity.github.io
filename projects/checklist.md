We want to develop a checklist to ensure that we are performing reproducible experiments and analyses. 
For some inspiration please check out the following paper from the [chemical machine learning community](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-021-00716-z).

To get things started, we suggest breaking this checklist into two parts: before the experiment and after the experiment. 

## Before the experiment (and the experimental plan)

1. Do you have a scientific question or questions that you want to answer?
    1. Have you spoken to an instrument scientist to determine if reflectivity can help you answer the question? 
    2. Don’t just say this system is interesting, please give us the beamtime? 
    3. Can you leverage techniques like contrast matching?
    4. Can you use complimentary x-ray reflectivity to improve the scientific outcome? IE. Resonant magnetic scattering/XMCD and PNR or NR and XRR. 
    5. Have you performed some basic simulations of what you expect to measure to get a feel for how the experiment will work? 
    6. Proposal writing: ???????????????
    7. Is the facility/Instrument answer the question that you are posting?
1.	Samples:
    1. Can you make the system if it is proposed? 
    2. If it’s not made can you do experiments to work out how to make it? (This will be its thread) 
    3. Can you make the sample reproducibility
    4. Can you make the sample big enough and flat enough for an NR/PNR/PA measurement? 
    5. Pre-characterisation of the sample? What do you need to do to know you have the correct effect (issues with chopping up samples etc) 
1.	Experimental plan: 
    1. Do you have an experimental plan on how to do the measurement to answer the scientific question or questions you state in the proposal? 
    2. Again have you spoke to the instrument scientist about what this entails and how much neutron time will be required (on a facility/instrument by instrument basis) 
    3. Is the beamline characterised/setup correctly, detector corrections, transmissions, Polarisationcorrects etc? 
    4. Have you run a pilot meausement to check how long you need to run for?
    5. Have you characterised your blocks in required correctly? 
    6. Have you taken sufficient transmissions etc through blocks and Sample environment etc?  
1.	Analysis planning:
    1. Do you have the expertise/capability to analyse the data? (Time /Personpower) 
    2. If not what do you think is need to get to a place you can analyse your data? 
    3.
