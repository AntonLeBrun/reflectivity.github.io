Artur made some suggestions for file extensions to be used / recommended for *our* formats / representations:
(with comments by Jochen)

### ASCII files

- `.ort` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **T**ext   
  (German: place)

### binary files

- `.orb` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **B**inary  
  (sphere)
- `.ors` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **S**trict  
  JS: *strict* is associated with the content rather than with the representation.
- `.orn` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **N**eXus
- `.orh` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **H**DF

### model description

- `.orm` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **M**odel
- `.orl` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **L**ayers   
  JS: model contains more than layers
- `.ors` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **S**tructure  
  see also binary files
- `.ord` **O**pen **R**eflectometry **D**escription  
  see also ASCII files

Attention: Several extensions are suggested in various categories!
