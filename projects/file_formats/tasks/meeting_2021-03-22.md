# Formal aspects of the ORSO ASCII represenation of data sets

On Monday, 2021-03-22, the following orso members met online to discuss and if possible agree on a 
number of tasks concerning formal aspects of the ASCII representation of the orso reflectivity data 
set. 

This working group included: 
Artur Glavic, Brian Maranville, Anrew Mcclusky, Max Skoda and Jochen Stahn. 

In the following the tasks are listed together with the mohst importand arguments and
if applicabla, the decission we made.

## General structure of the header

Based on the discussion of where to put the units (see next topic) we decided to
stick to the YAML or JASON rules. This allows for simpler data reading and writing
because standard routines can be used.

The drawback is that the header gets a bit less human readable, but we gain
much more flexibility to add further entries.

The actual format (YAML, JASON) is stated in the first header line. Artur will
make a suggsetion for this.


## Where to put units

The question was to ballance human and computer readability:

```YAML
#    <quantity>:  <magnitude> <unit> 
```

(compact, very close to the real-world formula)
versus

```YAML
#    <quantity>:
#         magnitude: <magnitude>
#         unit: <unit>
```

(fits standard, allows for extensions like `resolution:`, `min:`, ...)

The discussion took quite long and we agreed several times on one or the other.
The latter, strict version finally made it because it strongly simplifies the
programming of writers and readers.  

## How to write units

The discussion was about how to write the units and if several variants would be 
allowed. As long as SI unis are used things seem straight forward, but associated
units or those with non-ASCII spelling are not.

We agreed on

- only one version per unit
- Aangstroem is spelled `angstrom`, a capital A might collide with Ampere (which might
  show up in battery measurements)
- only ASCII symbols are to be used
- reciprocal units are written e.g. as `1/angstrom`
- exponents are marked with ** as e.g. in `1/angstrom**2` for SLD
- the *base units* are `rad`, `deg`, `m`, `mm`, `nm`, ... , `angstrom` and `s`

unsolved it the usage of $\mu$ as in micro meter.

## Comments

The question was how we should include comments in the header.

We agreed on 2 types:

- A comment to be used by some software (to be forwarded or displayed) starts with
  the key word `comment:` which can be used on any level of the hirarchy.

  example:

  ```YAML
  comment: |
    Attention! These data have been collected without the frame overlap mirror
    and contain thus some highly structured background.
  ```

- Everything behind a `#` in the header after the initial `^# ` will be ignored.
  This allows to write comments in the header which will be ignored by any software.
  This might be usefull to mark a hand-made alteration, e.g. when the autometically 
  entered value was wrong.

  example:

  ```YAML
  #     #omega: -.23
  #     # omega zero-position was not reset prior to measurement
  #     omega: 0.43
  ```

  **please comment on this**

## Column description

The column description in Jochen's example contained the key-value pair `column: <number>` 
which was not approved by most of the participants. We agreed to use a number-less list instead
of the type:

```YAML
# columns:
#     - {quantity:  Qz, unit: 1/angstrom}
#     - (quantity: RQz, unit:1}
#     - {quantity: sR, unit:1}
#     - {quantity: aQ, unit: 1/angstrom, comment: 'sigma of Gaussian resolution function'}
#     - {quantity: lambda, unit: angstrom}
```

The keyword `quantity:` might be changed. Suggestions?

## Steepness of hirarchies

We choose between the hierarchical approach:

```YAML
# wavelength:
#     value:           
#     min:             
#     max:             
#     resolution:
#         constant:    
#         proportional:
#         type:        
#     unit:            
```

which allows for a compact notation:

```
# wavelength:{min:4, max:12, resolution:{constant:0.1}, unit: nm }
```

and the flat approach:

```
# wavelength:                        
# wavelength_min:                    
# wavelength_max:                    
# wavelength_resolution_constant:    
# wavelength_resolution_proportional:
# wavelength_unit:                   
```

The hirarchcal one did win easily.


## Multiple data sets in one file

The question was wehter it should be possible to put several data sets in one file, or not.
Typical example is a set of related data with different spin states, but also series of
measureemnts or combinted angle- and wavelength-dependent data might be sored this way.

We soon agreed to allow for multiple data sets with the following rules:

- For one data set, nothing special needs to be written to the header.
- Each additional data set has to start with the line

  ```YAML
  # data_set: <identifier>
  ```

  where `<identifier>` might be a unique name or number. The default is that the first
  additional data set starts with number 1.

- For each additional data set the header of data set 0 applies if not explicitely
  overwritten.
- It is possible to overwrite the header information for any additional data set
  by inserting the corresponding lines with leading `# ` in between the separator
  and the data columns.



## Naming for spin states

After a very short discussion (*all versions will be problematic*) we agreed on

- `#     spin_state: +` for spin up polarisation, no spin analysis (or vice versa)
- `#     spin_state: -` for spin down polarisation, no spin analysis (or vice versa)
- `#     spin_state: ++` for spin up polarisation, spin up analysis
- `#     spin_state: +-` for spin up polarisation, spin down analysis
- `#     spin_state: --` for spin down polarisation, spin down analysis
- `#     spin_state: -+` for spin down polarisation, spin up analysis

## File extentions

Based on Artur's suggestions for file extensions we selected:

- `.ort` *= **o**pen **r**eflectometry **t**ext* for ASCII or UTF8 files
- `.orb` *= **o**pen **r**eflecrometry **b**inary* for binary files
- `.orm` *= **o**pen **r**eflectometry **m**odel* for model description

Artur checked that these extensions are not in user elsewhere.
