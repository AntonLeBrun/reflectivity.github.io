title: ORSO file format - text representation
author: Jochen Stahn, *Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland*

Material for the Annual General Assembly 2021.

## structure of the text data file

- header with meta data
- column description
- data set
- \[sub-header\]
- \[data set\]

## header with meta data

Wrapped YAML

- each line of the header starts with `# ` (hash and space)
- it is structured due to [YAML](https://yaml.org) or [JSON](https://www.json.org) rules
- all non-YAML entries start with an additional hash `#`


### the 1st line

The first line contains information about

- the general content;
- the orso file format version (and level of strictness) used;
- the encoding;
- a link to us.

```
# # ORSO reflectivity data file | 0.1 standard | YAML encoding | https://www.reflectometry.org/
```

### meta data 

What follows are several blocks with meta data, where the **dictionary is not yet
defined**. Thus here only the format, but not the content is mandatory.

The essential categories deal with

- the origin of the file
- the origin and meta information of the data
- the processing steps performed so far

fuhrer categories might be added, e.g.

- sample description (in- or output of analysis program)
- simulation / fitting history
- instrumental details for an improved resolution function

Here we concentrate on the essential ones:

#### origin / ownership of the file

Information about the one who created **this** file.

clear text:

*created*   
*by* Jochen Stahn    
*from* Paul Scherrer Institut    
*on* 2020-04-06T13:21:18    
*on the computer* lnsa17.psi.ch   

**suggestion** for the implementation (= the dictionary)

#### origin and ownership of the data

Here goes all the information about the ownership of the raw data, and
where and how they were obtained.

```

#### history of processing

This section should provide the possibility to reproduce the data reduction process. I.e. 
to recreate this file (except for the `creator` part) from the raw data. 

It also mentions the corrections performed so far. There might be a reference to a
well-defined algorithm in the future.

```
# reduction:
#     software: eos.py
#     call : eos.py -Y 2020 -n 1925-1927 -y 9,55 ni1000 -O -0.2 -r 1064 -s 1 -i -a 0.005 -e
#     comment:
#         corrections performed by normalisation to measurement on reference sample
#     corrections:
#          - footprint
#          - incident intensity
#          - detector efficiency
```



### column description

The last part of the header is the description of the columns to follow.

```
# columns:
#     - {name: Qz, unit: 1/angstrom, dimension: WW transfer}
#     - {name: R, dimension: reflectivity}
#     - {name: sR, dimension: error-reflectivity}
#     - {name: sQz, unit: 1/angstrom, dimension: resolution-WW transfer}
```

This is a compact notation for

```
# columns:
#     - name: Qz
#       unit: 1/angstrom
#       dimension: WW transfer
#     - name: R
#       dimension: reflectivity
#     - name: sR
#       dimension: error-reflectivity
#     - name: sQz
#       unit: 1/angstrom
#       dimension: resolution-WW transfer
```

In case there are multiple data sets (see below) it might be necessary to provide an
*identifier* also for the first data set. Thus there can be the optional line

```
# data set: <identifier>
```

Optionally, the last line might be a short-notation description

```
# #         Qz             RQz              sR              sQ
```

where the second `#` means that this is a comment line not to be processed.

### data set

Each data set consists of a rectangular array of numbers. All entries have the same
data type (the default is `float`). There is no leading space.

```
1.03563296e-02  3.88100068e+00  4.33909068e+00  5.17816478e-05
1.06717294e-02  1.16430511e+01  8.89252719e+00  5.33586471e-05
...
```

Suggestion to define the **size of each column** according to one of the following rules 
(with increasing rigidity):

- Each column can have its individual length, but the descriptive header must fit.
- All columns must have the same length
- All columns are 16 spaces wide, i.e. `% 16f`, `% 16g` or `% 16e`
- All columns have the format `% 16e`

### multiple data sets

In case there are several data sets in one file (e.g. for different spin states) the following
rules apply:

#### empty line

This is optional. An **empty line** is recognized by gnuplot as a separator
for 3 dimensional data sets.

#### separator

If more than one data set is provided, they are separated by a line starting with

```
# data_set: <identifier>
```

where the *identifier* is either an unique name or a number. The default numbering 
of data sets starts with 0, the first additional one thus gets number 1 and so on.

#### overwrite meta data

Below the separator line, meta data might be added. These overwrite the meta data 
supplied in the main header (i.e. data set 2 does not know anything about the changes made
for data set 1).

```
# data_source:
#     measurement:
#         polarisation: -
#     input_files:
#         data_files:
#             - file     : amor2020n001930.hdf
#               created  : 2020-02-03T15:27:45
# reduction:
#     call : eos.py -Y 2020 -n 1930 -y 9,55 ni1000 -O -0.2 -r 1064 -s 1 -i -a 0.005 -e
```

#### repetition of short-version column description

optional

```
# #         Qz             RQz              sR              sQ
```

#### next data set

of the same format (number, format and description of columns) as data set 0

```
1.03563296e-02  1.08100068e+00  4.33909068e+00  5.17816478e-05
1.06717294e-02  1.06430511e+01  8.89252719e+00  5.33586471e-05
...

### from example towards dictionary

legend:  
`1_` mandatory  (according to the principles)  
`2_` mandatory if applicable (e.g. proposal ID for large scale facilities)    
`3_` recommended    
`4_` optional    
`_1` easy to realize    
`_2` probably needs some programming  
`_3` probably needs some manual work (operator's name on the lab x-ray machine)
