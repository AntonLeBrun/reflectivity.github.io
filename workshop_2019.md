<h3> Structure </h3>

Each of the sessions was led by a chair.
The chair set the scene for the session by providing information about the current state of the art, as well as their opinion on how the area may be advanced (these primers were shared with participants before the event).
Finally, the chair set out 2-3 discussion topics to be tackled during the sessions.
Attendees then broke into groups of ~5 to discuss each of the topics and feedback to the large group, gradually working through each topic.
During the feedback sessions, one of the organisers minuted the feedback, which will be shared on this web resource imminently.
