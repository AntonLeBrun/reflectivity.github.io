The education and outreach working group aims to develop understanding of reflectivity techniques and disseminate information about reflectivity analysis.

At the recent [workshop](https://www.reflectometry.org/workshop_2020/) the Education & Outreach sessions tried to define the scope of the working group and discussed some detail on the design and content of the website and how to secure the long-term future of the ORSO collaboration. The discussions were wide ranging and agreement was not always reached. However, we were able to establish a list of [actions](https://github.com/reflectivity/edu_outreach/projects) that will hopefully put the organisation on a firm footing and mean that the website becomes a useful resource for those that are interested in reflectometry at all levels.

The full scope of the working group is now defined as:
* **Outreach & Dissemination:** The E&O working group should write news items and publicise the organisation at user meetings and conferences. This should include information on any standards that are established by the other working groups.
* **Website management:** The website is editable by any member of ORSO. The E&O working group is responsible for the content that is outward facing and educational.
* **Organization of annual meetings:** Each working group will have regular virtual meetings covering their specific issues with an annual in-person meeting once a year. The E&O working group will take primary responsibility for organising the annual meeting, and ideally this will be associated as a satellite to a bigger international conference.

To get involved in the E&O working group you should sign up to GitHub and take a look at the GitHub repository or Gitter message board. You can become a member by emailing the working group chair.
