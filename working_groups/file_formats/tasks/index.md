This is an attempt to collect the ideas and contributions from the ORSO meeting
in 2020 and the **file formats group workshop on September 30**.

The writing is still in progress, thus some entries below are close to the
keyword level. Please excuse me for that - or better: change it.

My idea is that we complete the list and fill in the results once a task
has been completed. 

Once decided, the topic moves form this task list to a still empty
list of recommendations.

Pleas add your name to the tasks you are interested in. This way
we might be able to form groups working together.

## Project organisation

**How do we structure our work?**   
We agreed to tackle the tasks (see below) in smaller groups according to
the interests and skills of the orso members.   
We forgot to for these groups.

**Which platform do we use?**   
For the moment this would be GitHub. I have the impression that 
most of us are not that familiar with this and the related nomenclature
(including me), so it might be a good idea if some expert could tell us.

**Time line**   
The *natural* order for developing the orso file format is something like 
this:

1. collection of ideas and concepts

2. discussion

3. preliminary decision

4. realisation for testing

5. revision and final decision

6. release

At the moment we mix stages 1 to 3 and stage 4 is in preparation.
Most likely this will lead to some loops, but on the upside we 
might learn some things and there is some visible progress...

**Chapters**   
J. Wuttke [suggested](https://github.com/jwuttke/file_format/blob/master/current_discussion/process.md)
to prepare *chapters* and to release them
individually once they are mature enough. This organisation
would also allow to opt out certain chapters according to 
institutional policy.

The problem there is that a lot of basic decisions are 
entangled and that once we agreed on them, there is not much
to split of as a separate chapter.
