ORSO is divided into four working groups which cover different aspects of this collaboration.
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="./working_groups/edu_and_outreach/">Education and outreach</a>: The education and outreach working group aims to develop understanding of reflectivity techniques and disseminate information about reflectivity analysis.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="./working_groups/file_formats/">File formats</a>: This working group aims to draft a spec for a standard file format to be used across X-ray and neutron reflectivity. This is an important goal to move towards interoperability across facilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="./working_groups/analysis/">Data Analysis</a>: The working group focused on data analysis is targetting a universal descriptive model language for reflectometry analysis. Additionally, they hope to develop test cases for reflectometry calculations to ensure robustivity across analysis software.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="./working_groups/reproducibility/">Reproducibility</a>: The reproducibility working group is focused on creating guidelines to ensure reproducibility of data reduction and analysis of neutron and X-ray reflectivity measurements.
  </li>
</ul>
