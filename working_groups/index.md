ORSO consists of four working groups, which cover different aspects of reflectometry:

- [**Education and Outreach**](./edu_and_outreach): The education and outreach working group aims to develop [understanding of reflectometry techniques](/information/learning) and catalogue information about [reflectometry information and software](/information/activities).
- [**File Formats**](./file_formats): This working group aims to draft a specification for a standard, shared file format that can be adopted across X-ray and neutron reflectometry. This is an important goal to move towards interoperability across facilities.
- [**Data Analysis**](./data_analysis): The data analysis group is targetting a [universal descriptive model language](/projects/model_language) for reflectometry analysis, and has generated useful information about the [computational efficiencies of reflectometry calculations](/information/calculation).
- [**Reproducibility**](./reproducibility): The reproducibility working group is focusing on investigating how we can improve reproducibility between beamlines and analysis processes, this includes [calibrations](/projects/calibrations) and [common references samples](standard_samples).
