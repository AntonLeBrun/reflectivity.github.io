## Below is an incomplete list of commonly asked questions which we hope may be useful, please feel free to add to it (with answers).



## How can I get my data?


Most facilities offer remote access for user data as long as you are associated with the experiment. Check the website of the facility, or for the following facilities go to these pages:

ILL â€“ www.data.ill.eu

ISIS - https://data.isis.stfc.ac.uk

Diamond - https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Users/Experiment-at-Diamond/IT-User-Guide/At-DLS/Access-data.html

ESRF - https://www.esrf.eu/home/UsersAndScience/support-and-infrastructure/Computing/ComputingOffsite/accessing-experimental-data.html 



## How do I get beamtime?

All facilities have different access mechanisms, but most operate on a schedule of proposal submissions, where you can submit a short (~ few pages) science proposal. The proposals are ranked by a panel of experts and the time available is awarded to the top applications. Many facilities offer a variety of access mechanisms and it is better to check the websites of the individual facilities to find out more.



## Who should I contact about an experiment?

If you have been assigned a local contact at the beamline then they will be your first point of contact, otherwise contact the instrument responsible. Contact details are usually available on the instrument web pages.



## I have done this ____ type of experiment, what fitting software should I use?

As detailed on this site, there are a myriad of fitting packages available to use, and most will work for every type of data. We do not recommend some over others, but if you are unfamiliar with the packages, then there are links to training resources associated with some of the packages. Note that not all packages are currently supported, and it is best to check the webpage of the software for up to date information.



## What does reflectivity tell you?

We are glad you asked! Please check out https://www.reflectometry.org/working_groups/edu_and_outreach/learning for an introduction or tutorial about the technique. Note that the same principles apply for both x-rays and neutrons.



## How can I join ORSO/help?

Please contact the chair of the working group which most interests you, or dive straight into the Github issues and take ownership of one (e.g. for reproducibility: https://github.com/reflectivity/reproducibility/projects/2)
