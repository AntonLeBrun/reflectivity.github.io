## Table of Synchrotron X-ray reflectometry instruments

At synchrotron and free electron laser Light Sources there are many instruments that can be used for X-ray reflectometry. Please find a list of suggestions below. For a complete list of all x-ray scattering beamlines in Europe please visit, [Way For Light](https://www.wayforlight.eu/en/catalogue?Techniques=1394) database. (please note that the Way for Light database includes instruments that may use the term reflectometry for other techniques)
[Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Techniques.html) has a good set of definitions of the various techniques that are possible at synchrotrons. Acronyms used in the table below are consistent with these definitions.
