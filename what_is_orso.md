This is an online home for the Open Reflectivity Standards Organisation (ORSO), a collaborative network of scientists interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_reflectometry">neutron</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_reflectivity">X-ray</a> reflectometry.
It should be noted that the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectometry">reflectometry</a> is also used for a number of techniques that are not covered by this organisation.
<br><br>
It is intended that this website contains information relevant to all levels of interst in reflectometry.
<br><br>
We have a number of educational <a href="./info">resources</a> for reflectometry and directories of reflectometry instrumentation.
<br><br>
The organisation has had two workshops to date and more are planned. Details can be found <a href="./workshops">here</a>.
