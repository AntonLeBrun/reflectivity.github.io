This is the repository for the Open Reflectometry Standards Organisation (ORSO), which is currently hosted at [reflectometry.org](reflectometry.org).

## Contributing guidence

Firstly, thank you for considering helping with the ORSO webpage! 
To get started, first you need to get write access to this repository, to do so:

1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join)
2. Contact a [current owner](https://github.com/orgs/reflectivity/people), giving them your Github username and explaining why you would like to participate, if you do not have contact details for any of the current owners [contact Andrew](mailto:andrew.mccluskey@diamond.ac.uk)
3. You should then receive an email from Github (allow time for the current owner to read your email as this process is not automated) inviting you to become either a member or owner

Once you have write access to this repository, the following actions will allow you to change the content on the website:

1. Find the page that you want to edit (for example, we want to add another reflectometer to [the list of reflectometers](https://www.reflectometry.org/info/reflectometers/))
2. Note the relative path of the url (in our example, the url is `https://www.reflectometry.org/info/reflectometers/` so the relative path is `info/reflectometers/`)
3. Find your way to this file in the webpage repository (there is a directory `info`, inside which there is a file called `reflecometers.md`)
4. Once on the page that you want to edit, click the small pencil icon in the upper right of the page
5. This will open a version of the page that can be edited, note that all of the content on these pages is written in the [markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
6. Make the edits that you want to the page, then add a description of your changes in the text box below (typically this will have the default text `Update <file_name>.md`
7. Click the green commit changes button at the bottom
8. Give the website a few minutes to rebuild, and you should be able to see you changes live!

If you have any suggestions on how to clarify these guidelines, please feel free to change them.
