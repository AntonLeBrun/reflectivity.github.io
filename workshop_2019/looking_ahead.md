### What next?

There was broad support for the formation of working groups:

- Analysis
- Reproducibility
- Education and Outreach
- File formats

These groups will be mainly organised online but will reconvene in Lund next year.

Possible tasks for the working groups include:

- Draft a standard file format (File formats)
- Develop a descriptive model language (Analysis) 
- Definition of test cases (Analysis)
- Sample description for the file format (File formats) 
- Data reduction and analysis reproducibility (Reproducibility) 
- Collection and documentation of existing software (Education and Outreach)
- Guidelines (Reproducibility) 

Each working group will set achievable goals to be carried out before the Lund workshop. 

- Aim to have both working group break out and broader meeting in Lund
- Make contact with other facilities (including instrument manufacturers) to grow the group
