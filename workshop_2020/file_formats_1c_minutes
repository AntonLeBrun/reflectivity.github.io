Nobody will use Nexus coordinate system (z is along beam rather than perp to sample surface) if we impose it, but where/how do we make a coordinate system?

Can use the reduced nexus standard to “rename” things i.e. Qz > Q_reduced_Z

Units – default and optional choices, but do we accept others? 

File format – Nexus won’t have much uptake with users as is a bit “clunky” for “looking” at data, .dat is easier, but less in line with standardisation.

Two separate files may be better (if a little clunky) ascii and nexus. Link inside ascii to HDF? (probably need both)

Polarisation – How to deal with the multiple columns? 

Do we just define standard way to label and describe the process?

When making the “standard” we have a minimum required, and options. If options are used then they MUST be done in the “right” way. Different Levels?

Minimum: Q and/or (wavelength + angle), R and/or I, date, origin, units… but then too many options? Define a minimum.

- TODO describe in detail the minimum for voting on at the next meeting, possible also levels above too.

When writing down suggestions, also add the reasoning behind the choices as the discussion is as valuable as the results
