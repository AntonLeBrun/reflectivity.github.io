Reproducibility 3b

Jos Cooper, Artur Glavic, Jochen Stahn, Francesco Carla, CJK

Separate all pieces out, beamline, reduction, analysis

How to actually define a reproducible measurement? DO we need a standard sample? â€“ take a long time (future aim)

Describe all common checking procedures? 

ORSO website first before publication so it can be discussed, but peer review publication afterwards

A statistical check that any sample measured twice on a beamline is the same to a defined accuracy (chi squared, etc)

**Want to publish some code to check if data is always the same, and if a fit is the same**

Work on single instrument reproducibility first, inter after but round robin type investigation?

Analysis validation is already in progress (same sample re-run in program gives same result)
