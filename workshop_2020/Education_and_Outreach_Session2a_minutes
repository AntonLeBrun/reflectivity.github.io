Topics:
 
What should the ORSO webpage contain? 
1) Basically a copy of reflectometry.net, especially with links to text books and literature, but with a better layout and an engine, which is easier to maintain , like GitHub, Wiki etc... and in addition:
2) More literature and information concerning X-rays
3) Some kind of an arXiv section with all reflectometry papers available, especially recent ones to make them visible to the community asap. It was made clear that the website should not host these manuscripts but only link to them, e.g. via a search engine
4) Links to webinars or youtube videos explaining reflectometry
5) Links to press releases coming from work done with reflectometry
6) Links to other ORSO content
7) Acknowledgements of fundings
8) The "world list of reflectometers" should also include synchrotron based X-ray machines, but given the large amount of machines maybe a link to the large scale facility is enough? It was mentioned, though, that often the instrument responsible is the right contact to plan an experiment rather than the facility webpage.
 
Who should be the audience of the web page?
9) At the moment reflectometry.org seems to be for experts, but it was proposed to include new users as well, even those who are curious about what reflectometry is good for. The majority agreed to broaden the target audience of the website to new users as well, but not as the first contact point for reflectometry, but rather to users attracted during conferences or lectures and pointed towards the website as a reference compilation.
Maybe the website should make a clearer distinction between the parts meant to be read by experts,  like information about data formats agreed on, and parts meant to be for new users.
 
Who should maintain the website?
10) The website should be formally maintained by the current admins, but anyone from the reflectometry community, notably the attendees of the ORSO workshops, can ask for access through Andrew McCluskey sending him the GitHub user name and contribute to the content.
 
And how to keep up to date with the developments?
11) Check the message board regularly (https://gitter.im/reflectivity/edu_and_outreach)  accessible to everyone.
 
 
Actions:
 
- Tom and Andrew: Create blank pages for text books and literature similar to reflectometry.net and for webinars
 
- All attendees: Fill these pages with the content you are aware of, after getting access through Andrew
