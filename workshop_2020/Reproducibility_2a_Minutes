How to show what goes wrong when not reproducible?

Beam time vs reproducibility tension – panels could add weight to proposals which mention it? ORSO could petition facilities? Include in proposal perhaps? 

Repository of reduced/analysed data? Allowing cross checking for popular datasets (i.e.make sure everything is ok without having to do the whole experiment)

Experimental design teaching materials published by ORSO for reproducible experiments?

Some horror stories to “convince” users? 

(AN XRR round robin paper exists http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0021889807051904)
High brightness sources may have more issues (coherence)
