Start with existing nexus and “correct” AND start from scratch and compare for small set of definitions to work out way forward

Definitions for all cases? – probably required from start but still extensible

Only do reduced file format as “raw” is too instrument specific

Detector coordinate system not needed? Convert to angles in reduced data format (enough information to reconstruct though)

Mrinal + Wei to look at NXS from x-rays, J-F from neutrons
