Model building
•	Can we find a common language to talk about systems, similar to CIFs?
•	Compare to other technique, allow joint refinement.
•	Do people share the same vocabulary, is it clear what we mean if we give parameter values?
  o	  Parameterization needs to be correct, so constraints have to be included.
  o	  Should be easy to implement numerically.
  o	  Examples would be lipid leaflets, magnetization description within layers
  o	  Go beyond things already described in models to include solutions that are not too well documented
  o	  Processes of how physics is translated to SLD functions is important, example is large roughnesses, correlated vs. not correlated
•	Sharing output from different models in publications
•	Probably not achievable in this meeting, so what is our approach?
  o	  collect terms offline
  o	  find descriptions that are common and different
  o	  discuss in next workgroup meeting
•	Can we translate between program models?
  o	  We could propose a slap standard text format for publications/program import-export
  o	  A common model builder for different programs
  o	  Collect example models, maybe allow submission as pull request or email
•	Artur will put spaces on the website to collect the thins above
