Model building
- Can we find a common language to talk about systems, similar to CIFs?
- Compare to other technique, allow joint refinement.
- Do people share the same vocabulary, is it clear what we mean if we give parameter values?
  - Parameterization needs to be correct, so constraints have to be included.
  - Should be easy to implement numerically.
  - Examples would be lipid leaflets, magnetization description within layers
  - Go beyond things already described in models to include solutions that are not too well documented
  - Processes of how physics is translated to SLD functions is important, example is large roughnesses, correlated vs. not correlated
- Sharing output from different models in publications
- Probably not achievable in this meeting, so what is our approach?
  - collect terms offline
  - find descriptions that are common and different
  - discuss in next workgroup meeting
- Can we translate between program models?
  - We could propose a slap standard text format for publications/program import-export
  -  A common model builder for different programs
  - Collect example models, maybe allow submission as pull request or email
- Artur will put spaces on the website to collect the thins above
